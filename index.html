                <p>The Hass avocado presents a profitable opportunity for growers, with its high nutritional value and increasing demand both domestically and internationally. This proposal outlines a plan to establish Hass avocado orchards in Nandi County, Kenya, and connect farmers with potential buyers. The revenue generated from this project will be used to provide sanitary pads in the whole constituency, improve the sports sector, expand other investments in the constituency, and expand the project.</p>
